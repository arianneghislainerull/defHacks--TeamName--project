### The Models

face_landmarks.dat and video.h5 is a pre-trained machine learning system that is
used for facial detection and emotional recognition.

It is how we are able to detect the user's face and recognize which emotion they
are expressing by looking at there facial expressions.

Both were not trained by us and credit goes to the [Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition](https://github.com/maelfabien/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition/blob/master/README.md#iv-methodology)
project.
