### The Models

face_landmarks.dat and video.h5 are pre-trained machine learning systems that are
used for facial detection and emotion recognition.

These models are how we are able to detect the user's face and recognize which emotion they
are expressing.

Both were not trained by us and credit goes to the [Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition](https://github.com/maelfabien/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition/blob/master/README.md#iv-methodology)
project.
